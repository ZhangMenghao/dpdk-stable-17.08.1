# TRIPOD: Towards a Scalable, Efficient and Resilient Cloud Gateway

About
--
TRIPOD is a scalable, high-performance, failure-resilient network function framework for cloud gateways. This is a joint work with Baidu INc., and most of the design insights are based on the scenario of Baidu cloud gateways. Any suggestions are appreciated as TRIPOD is still a research prototype. Please feel free to send email to us for any questions.
